Required to retain control of the Kindle firmware version and make the ''Update Your Kindle'' (UYK) menu item available.

== Prevent OTA Update ==

In the topmost visible level of USB storage, add the OTA blocking directory name.<br />
The blocking directory name is:<br />
''update.bin.tmp.partial''<br />
Use that exact name, no additional extension.

== Register the Kindle ==

With some firmware versions, you can not access the ''Update Your Kindle'' (UYK) menu unless the device is registered. All of the KOA2 experimental <span>*</span>.bin packages install with UYK. Using MrPI is not required.

= Recommended =

The following changes are all in support of recovering the Kindle should start-up problems occur. Each can prevent the export of USB storage until a touch screen action is taken. But most start-up problems occur before the touch screen is up and working.

* Remove any passcode protection.
* Remove any parental controls.
* Have special offers removed.

= [sec:Check-current-firmware]Check current firmware =

Test if the Kindle can be jail broken with the current firmware.

* Download [https://www.adrive.com/public/U3AVtU/main-htmlviewer.tar.gz Device Jail Break]

Do not let your PC open that archive or otherwise convert it to a ''safe'' archive. The archive content structure makes it a tar bomb, it is suppose to be a tar bomb, that is what makes it work. Owners of <span>MacOS</span> systems should be aware that the default settings will open and convert this archive to a ''safe'' archive, which prevents it from working as intended.

#: To be certain, use your PC to look for it in the /documents folder. In this case you will have to install a ''Factory Use Only'' firmware build as described below.

= Install a ''Factory Use Only'' firmware build =

If the ''JailBroken'' document showed up on your Kindle when you did step [enu:Did-you-have] of section [sec:Check-current-firmware] above, you may skip this section.

== Replace your ''Customer Use'' firmware build with a ''Factory Use Only'' firmware. ==

In this case, the firmware version numbers before and after this step are not significant.

The use of the word ''Update'' means the label on the button in the settings menu, it does not describe the action performed.

# Download the firmware image that was intended to only be used on the factory production line: [https://www.adrive.com/public/RyfAaK/update_kindle_oasis_9th_factory_5.9.0.6.bin Factory-5.9.0.6].
# Place in the topmost visible level of USB storage.
# Remove USB cable.
# Home -&gt; Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Menu -&gt; Update (Your Kindle - UYK)
# Wait.<br />
Do not panic. These factory image package may take as long as 5 minutes to install.
